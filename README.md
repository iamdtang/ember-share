# ember-share

Share your local Ember apps with the world using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). No additional software installation is required once the Ember CLI addon is installed.

## Installation

```
ember install ember-share
```

## How to Use

To share your site, simply run `ember share`, which behaves like `ember serve`. A publicly accessible URL will be inserted into your clipboard that is ready to paste directly into your browser.

This was inspired by [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/valet#sharing-sites).
